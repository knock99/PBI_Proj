# PowerBI_Project
---
## Introduction:
Using this player data, I will compare 2 players and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. I will use Microsoft Power BI as my tool and using graphs and different visuals I will show the difference between the players. I want to show one player who is on an expiring contract and compare with someone who recently signed a big deal. These comparisons are done by agents and teams while negotiating contracts. For example if a similar production player takes a discount this hurts other players leverage in free agency.

## Plan:
This project will demonstrate player value and comparison with a similar player. This is usually done for arbitration or salary negotiations. It could also apply to trading for a player with similar value but lower salary (Money Ball).  I will use a mix of SQL, SSIS, and Power BI finally to visualize my findings. Loading my CSVâ€™s and tables with SSIS. Using SQL to do some EDA and write my scripts for SSIS. Power BI will ultimately be my focus and making visualizations that capture the story of the data.

## Scope:
### Technical:
##
The scope of this project will be a handful of pertinent stats that measure a players value. There are a couple useful advanced stats but will stay away from getting too cluttered with nonsensical information. Once I have these narrowed down Ill take them and see what the glaring differences or similarities are. This will mostly be done in Excel, SSIS and SQL. Finally I will be scoping down the best stats to visually compare in Power BI. I dont want to over do it but more so looking to keep it clean with simple charts and slicers.  

### Business:
##
From a business stand point the team would use this data to pay a player as little as possible. For example either highlighting defensive short comings or limited offensive production in certain situations(5 on 5 vs 5 on 4). The comparisons to other players could give either the team or player leverage depending upon the results. Overall the recent rise of analytics in hockey is still in its infancy. Some advanced stats should be taken with a grain of salt because you still need to pass the eye test.
