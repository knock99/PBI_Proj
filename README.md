# PowerBI_Project
---
Using this player data, I will compare 2 players and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. I will make a presentation on Microsoft Power BI to compare. Using graphs and different visuals I will show the difference between the players and their current salary/ value.

## Plan:
This project will demonstrate player value and comparison with a similar player. This is usually done for arbitration or salary negotiations. It could also apply to trading for a player with similar value but lower salary (Money Ball).  I will use a mix of SQL, SSIS, and Power BI finally to visualize my findings. Loading my CSVâ€™s and tables with SSIS. Using SQL to do some EDA and write my scripts for SSIS. Power BI will ultimately be my focus and making visualizations that capture the story of the data.
